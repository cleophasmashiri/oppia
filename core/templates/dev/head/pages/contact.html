          <p>
            Thank you for your interest in Oppia!
          </p>

          <p>
            If you have a question relating to this site, you can get in touch
            by posting to our <a href="{{SITE_FORUM_URL}}">forum</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            If there is a specific bug or feature request
            you would like to let us know about that is relevant to the
            open-source Oppia codebase, please create an issue on the
            <a href="https://code.google.com/p/oppia/issues/list">Oppia bug tracker</a>. You can also get in touch with the developers of the open-source Oppia codebase via the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/oppia-dev">developers' forum</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you need to contact the admins privately (for example, in order to report
            a security bug), you can email them at {{ADMIN_EMAIL_ADDRESS}}. Please
            use the above two channels where possible, though, since you are
            likely to get a faster response there.
          </p>
